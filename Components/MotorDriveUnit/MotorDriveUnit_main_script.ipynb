    "This is a model of motor drive unit (MDU), which is a system consisting of an electric motor and a controller. This MDU model is abstract and simulates the high-level behavior of power conversion between electric and mechanical powers by considering power conversion efficiency or losses.\n",

    "The core system equations of the MDU model are generally as follows.\n",

    "where $J$ is motor inertia. $t$ time. $\\omega \\;$ rotor angular speed. $\\tau_{\\textrm{rot}}$ torque at motor rotor. $\\tau_{\\textrm{cmd}}$ torque command input to MDU. $k_f$ rotor frictional damping coefficient. $P_{\\textrm{mech}}$ mechanical power. $P_{\\textrm{elec}}$ electrical power whose sign indicates if the system is generating or consuming electric power. $P_{\\textrm{elecloss}}$ electrical losses which can be modelled as a scalar constant, a formula as a function of motor speed etc., or a tabulated map. $i$ and $V$ electric current and voltage drop, respectively, connected to DC power supply. $P_{\\textrm{copper}}$ copper loss. $P_{\\textrm{iron}}$ iron loss. $P_{\\textrm{fixed}}$ fixed loss which is constant across the whole operating region. Front factors $k_c$ and $k_i$ are explained for each model below. $M_{\\textrm{therm}}$ thermall mass of MDU. $T_m$ MDU temperature. $Q$ heat flow rate input to MDU.\n",

    "This component provides the following four models based on the above formulation. These models are highly abstract and run fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Basic model** (<samp>MotorDriveUnit_refsub_Basic</samp>) is the simplest model with the fewest parameters among the four models. It uses [Motor & Drive block](https://www.mathworks.com/help/sdl/ref/motordrive.html) from Simscape Driveline. This model takes torque command and computes power conversion between electrical and mechanical powers using the **single efficiency measurement model** to compute copper loss coefficient $k_c$ . Irons loss $P_{\\textrm{iron}}$ and fixed loss $P_{\\textrm{fixed}}$ are not modeled. This model does not simulate temperature dynamics. See a [note](matlab:openFile('MotorDriveUnit_note_Efficiency_Basic')) for more information about efficiency.\n",
    "-  **Basic thermal model** (<samp>MotorDriveUnit_refsub_BasicThermal</samp>) uses [Motor & Drive block](https://www.mathworks.com/help/sdl/ref/motordrive.html), which is the same block as the above Basic model uses, but with thermal model enabled to simulate motor temperature dynamics.\n",
    "-   **System-level model** (<samp>MotorDriveUnit_refsub_System</samp>) uses [Motor & Drive (System-Level) block](https://www.mathworks.com/help/sps/ref/motordrivesystemlevel.html) from Simscape Electrical to compute power conversion between electrical and mechanical powers. Thermal model is enabled too. Power conversion model is the same as the one in Basic and Basic thermal models above, i.e., the **single efficiency measurement model**, but irons loss $P_{\\textrm{iron}}$ and fixed loss $P_{\\textrm{fixed}}$ are also considered in this model. See a [note](matlab:openFile('MotorDriveUnit_note_Efficiency_System')) for more information about efficiency.\n",
    "-   **System-level model with tabulated losses** (<samp>MotorDriveUnit_refsub_SystemTable</samp>) uses [Motor & Drive (System-Level) block](https://www.mathworks.com/help/sps/ref/motordrivesystemlevel.html) from Simscape Electrical. It takes torque command and computes motor speed which is the same as the other models above, but for power conversion efficiency or losses, this model uses tabulated parameter data as a function of motor speed and torque $P\\left(\\tau_{\\textrm{rot}} ,\\omega \\;\\right)$ instead of the single efficiency measurement model. Thermal model is disabled, but you can enable it if you have two data sets of efficiency or losses measured at two different temperatures.\n",
    "## Simulation cases\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate the MDU component, a harness model is used to run some simulation cases. Click the links below to see the simulation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  [Drive](matlab:openFile('MotorDriveUnit_simulationCase_Drive')) ... MDU drives axle by consuming electric power.\n",
    "-  [Regenerative braking](matlab:openFile('MotorDriveUnit_simulationCase_RegenBrake')) ... Axle drives motor, and MDU generates electric power.\n",
    "-  [Random](matlab:openFile('MotorDriveUnit_simulationCase_Random')) .... Input signals for motor torque command and axle load torque are randomly generated.\n",
    "-  [Constant](matlab:openFile('MotorDriveUnit_simulationCase_Constant')) ... All inputs are constant. This is used to check that the harness model runs.\n",
