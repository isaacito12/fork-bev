# Git branch name and zip file

In GitHub, you can download a zip file of a repository
by clicking the "Code" button, and then selecting "Download ZIP".
_Zip files do not include git data._

The branch name of this repository uses MATLAB release such as R2024b
so that the filename of a zip file
becomes like `repository_name-MATLAB_release.zip`.
For example, if the repository name is `MyRepository1` and
the branch name is `R2024b`, the zip file is named as `MyRepository1-R2024b.zip`.
