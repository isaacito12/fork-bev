# MATLAB Testing Framework

## Interactive or programmatic testing in MATLAB

This project includes tests which check that
models and scripts run without errors and warnings.
The main product feature used for testing is
[MATLAB Testing Frameworks][url-test].
Specifically, [class-based unit test][url-classbased] is implemented
for each component, BEV system model, and the project.

You can run tests interactively in MATLAB Editor.
Open [Test Browser][url-testbrowser] to see pass/fail status of the tests
as you run tests.
Test Browser also lets you measure code coverage.

For MATLAB projects, you can also use
[MATLAB Test Manager][url-testmanager] to run tests and measure code coverage.
(It requires the MATLAB Test license.)
MATLAB Test Manager can find test files in the project
and lets you run them all at once or individually.

Each unit test comes with a test runner script (`*_runtests.m`).
You can use test runner scripts to run tests programmatically.
These test files are stored in the `Test` folders.
Similar to the Test Browser, the test runner script runs tests
and reports pass/fail summary.
It also measures MATLAB Code coverage for files listed in
the test runner script and generates a coverage report.

Starting from R2023b, you can also run tests
with the new `buildtool` command from [MATLAB Build Tool][url-buildtool].
MATLAB Build Tool supports not only unit test,
but also code coverage measurement,
code issues checking, custom tasks,
building task dependencies, and more.
Programmatic test execution in this project will eventually
be migrated to MATLAB Build Tool.

[Code Analyzer app][url-analyzer] can identify issues in the code files.
You can open the app by clicking Code Analyzer shortcut button in
the Project Shortcuts tab.

## Automated testing in continuous integration

Test files introduced above can be used locally in your machine
where you run a test runner script in MATLAB.
If you also have a remote repository server for source control
(such as GitHub or GitLab),
you can use the same test files to automatically test
the project when you push local changes to the remote.

If your repository is a public repository in github.com,
you can use MATLAB and other toolboxes for free
in GitHub Actions Continuous Integration service.
For more information, see the documentation linked below.
