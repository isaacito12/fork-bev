App Layout","  % This class implements component placement logic using uigridlayout.","  %","  % There are four key elements in this layout logic: Area, Column, Row, and Slot.","  %","  % Area is the top level element of LiteAppLayout.","  % When you create a LiteAppLayout object, a new Area is created.","  % Areas are added from top to bottom in a window as you call NewArea method.","  % An Area can contain Columns or LiteAppComponent.","  %","  % Column is the second level element of LiteAppLayout.","  % You can create a Column with NewColumn method.","  % Columns are added from left to right within an Area as you call NewColumn method.","  % A Column can contain Rows or LiteAppComponent.","  %","  % Row is the third level element of LiteAppLayout.","  % You can create a Row with NewRow method.","  % Rows are added from top to bottom within a Column as you call NewRow method.","  % A Row can contain Slots or LiteAppComponent.","  %","  % Slot is the fourth level element of LiteAppLayout.","  % You can create a Slot with NewSlot method.","  % Slots are added from left to right within a Row as you call NewSlot method.","  % A Slot can contain LiteAppComponent.","  %","  % NewColumn and NewSlot can take the Width option.","  % The Width option is passed to uigridlayout as its ColumnWidth property.","  % You can use values that are supported by ColumnWidth,","  % such as \"1x\", \"2x\", \"fit\", 100, 200 etc.","  %","  % LiteAppLayout is one of LiteAppComponent.","  % Any of Area, Column, Row, and Slot can take a LiteAppLayout object.","  % This lets you create a
